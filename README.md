Kata 
====

Try something to store Kata and other experimentations on code... 

Here is some kata I have try to do. 
I build this repo with a branch per language. 
I store only kata that I have done (or start) with a language. 
Each Kata's subject are in sub directory. 
For version, I try to tag before I start a new version Kata (tag with kata's name and version).

Let see if I can do that...

For now, there is 2 branch:
- Haskell https://github.com/yaf/Katas/tree/Haskell
- Ruby  https://github.com/yaf/Katas/tree/Ruby
