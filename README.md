Kata 
====

Here is some kata I have try to do. 
I build this repo with a branch per language. 
I store only kata that I have done (or start) with a language. 
Each Kata's subject are in sub directory. 
For version, I try to tag before I start a new version Kata (tag with kata's name and version).

Let see if I can do that...
