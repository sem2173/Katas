Kata 
====

Try something to store Kata and other experimentations on code... 

Here is some kata I have try to do. 
I build this repo with a branch per language. 
I store only kata that I have done (or start) with a language. 
Each Kata's subject are in sub directory. 
For version, I try to tag before I start a new version Kata (tag with kata's name and version).

Ok, I add directory with kata subject, a readme to explain it and try to add test for some languages
Let see if I can do that...

For now, there is 3 branch:

* Haskell
* Ruby
* Go


Les exercices sont issu de divers source dont:
* Le coding dojo http://wiki.agile-france.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement
* un site sur le TDD qui vise à regrouper lui aussi une serie d'exercice https://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/all-problems-1
